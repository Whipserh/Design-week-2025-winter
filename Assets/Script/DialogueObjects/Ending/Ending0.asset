  dialogue:
  - Stars belong in the sky, unreachable but ever-present.
  - And the stories they hold with them are eternal stories of us.
  - So I hope, Little Dipper, that you would remember me by taking this piece of
    me home.
  - And tell my story to the ones who gaze on the North Star for guidance to the
    place they belong.
